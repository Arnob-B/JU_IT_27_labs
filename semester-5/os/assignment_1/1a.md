# Intro
commands given bellow will run fine if u have either of these 4 on your device
- wsl for windows users
- any linux distribution
- macos
- for android users u have termux

---
still dont have anything to run the commands ? <br>

![i got u bro](https://i.imgflip.com/a15laq.jpg)
<br>
online terminals
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compilers/online-linux-terminal.htm

> [!WARNING]
> some commands require a tty (ie a interactive terminal to run)
> clear, top, less, more and ping

---
# now that we are done with the terminal lets get to the good part
pre-req : read the guidline and file instructions [home](./../readme.md)

i will provide details of the command , ie what they do
how to input should look like 

what u will have to do is 
- run the command in the terminal and copy the command as well the output and put that in a sh file
    istruction for the file is given in [file_format instructions](./../file_format.md)
    ```sh
    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # Lots of Comments (Roll No, Assignment info etc.)
    # .....
    # .....

    # Q1. < Describe the Command >
    # < Write the Command >
    # < Output of the Command>

    # ........
    # ........
    ```
- all the commands and their respective output should be in the same file
- Sir will un-comment the code and then paste it in his terminal and then his output should be exact(or close)  to yours. 
    - obviously both of them will not match exactly for some specific commands like date , whoami, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> u can write smart multi commands 

command to show content of a file using shell
```shell
touch newFile && echo  "hello world" > newFile && cat newFile
```

```
is used as "and" condition ie if command2 fails then all the commands after command2 will never get executed
#### ";"
```shell
command1 ; command2 ; command3 ; ...
```
is used when commands are Independent ie if command2 fails then all the commands after command2 will get executed as they are supposed to be
