```c 
events events_arr[] = { START_LOOPING, PRINT_HELLO, PRINT_HELLO, PRINT_HELLO, PRINT_HELLO, PRINT_HELLO,PRINT_HELLO,PRINT_HELLO,STOP_LOOPING,PRINT_HELLO,PRINT_HELLO,STOP_LOOPING};↲
```
change this to 
```c 
enum events events_arr[] = { START_LOOPING, PRINT_HELLO, PRINT_HELLO, PRINT_HELLO, PRINT_HELLO, PRINT_HELLO,PRINT_HELLO,PRINT_HELLO,STOP_LOOPING,PRINT_HELLO,PRINT_HELLO,STOP_LOOPING};↲
```
we are just adding enum tag to refer to events
